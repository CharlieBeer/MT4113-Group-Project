Description: This package is designed to optimise a wide variety of functions
  via one of five methods—grid search, bisection method, univariate Newton, 
  multivariate Newton and Gauss-Newton. Users have the option to select one of 
  these methods, and also input a variety of analytic functions to speed up 
  processing time if desired. All functions in this package are tied to the parent
  function 'funoptim', and this should be the only function users need to call.
